# piTrainer

In honor of Google's new PI game on their calculator.

I was frustrated that every time I failed,I neded to start from square one, so I've re-created the game and included a prompt
to enter the number of digits after the decimal they would like to start the game with.

As i'm learning Ruby, I decided to make this into an exercise. 
Future plans include translating this to Javascript, giving it a nice front end, and deploying :)
